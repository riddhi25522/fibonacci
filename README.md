code to generate fibonacci sequnce.
he Fibonacci series is a fascinating sequence of numbers in which each term is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. The mathematical relationship is defined by the recurrence relation F(1)=1. As the sequence progresses, it unfolds into a pattern of 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. One of the remarkable aspects of the Fibonacci sequence is its additive property, where each number beyond the initial terms is derived from the sum of its two predecessors. This leads to a rapid and dynamic growth pattern. Beyond its mathematical significance, Fibonacci numbers and the sequence itself have practical applications in various fields, such as algorithms, number theory, and modeling natural phenomena. Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence and the associated golden ratio often appear in the aesthetics of art, architecture, and nature, further contributing to its widespread intrigue and relevance.
